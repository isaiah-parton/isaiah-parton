I started teaching myself programming at 11 to make video games.  Javascript and html canvas led to C++, which led to frustration with C++, which led to Odin my new daily compiler.  I also like some good-old-fashioned languages like C and Pascal.  I like UX design and databases.  I admire simplicity.
