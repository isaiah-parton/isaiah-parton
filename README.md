# Me
  - 🖥️ Favorite languages: [Odin](https://odin-lang.org/), [Rust](https://rust-lang.org) and [C++](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)
# My projects
  - 🕹️ An noita-like, story-driven rpg with [Raylib](https://raylib.com)
  - 💀 An immediate-mode gui library for Odin
  - 🏪 And a fast, minimal, but powerful point-of-sale terminal for small businesses (which uses said gui library)
